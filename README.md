# TheOneBot

> Was a functional discord bot system "proof of concept" if you will written in Visual Basic using discord .net libraries for windows with ease of access and customization in mind.

> This should only realy be used as a time capsule of what I was up to in the summer of 2018, while being quite ill. The lack of cleanliness as well as comments are no longer representative of my current habbits as a programmer.
